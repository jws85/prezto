Colored Man Pages
=================

This plugin colorizes man pages.  Not much else to say about it.

I grabbed this code from [oh-my-zsh][1], the contents of *init.zsh* is literally
the plugin code that can be found under OMZ's *plugins/colored-man-pages*
folder ([here][2]).

There was no author information in the actual file; of course you can look
at the OMZ blame log for this plugin at the previously linked GitHub page.
