My personal repository of zsh hacks that I'm not bothering to package
up, but that I'd like to synchronize between machines.

Emacs
-----

I use [a script I made][1] to launch emacsclient in a frame.  I find
it useful for a variety of things, but in particular I've taken to
launching some of the more useful emacs "apps" like Calc and Magit in
their own frames.

This code simply wraps around this script further to launch specific
apps; I count this as a "personal" hack as a lot of the functions are
calls to self-written defuns in [my .emacs setup][2].
